# GitHub Actions Workflow Testing Plan — ✅ DONE

> **Goal:** Introduce automated testing for the repository's GitHub Actions
> workflows so that YAML misconfigurations, shell-script logic errors, and
> workflow-integration regressions are caught before they reach the default
> branch. The plan compares every viable tool — `act` CLI, `actionlint`,
> Bats, Python/pytest-based options, and GitHub's Local Action Debugger —
> recommends a layered testing strategy, and provides a phased rollout.

## 1. Current State

### 1.1 Workflow Inventory

The repository has 11 GitHub Actions workflow files:

| # | Workflow | File | Trigger(s) | Lines |
|---|---------|------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | CI | `ci.yml` | `push`, `pull_request` | 61 |
| 2 | Unit Tests | `test-unit.yml` | `push`, `pull_request` | 44 |
| 3 | Integration Tests | `test-integration.yml` | `push`, `pull_request` | 52 |
| 4 | Benchmarks | `benchmark.yml` | `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` | 90 |
| 5 | Docs | `docs.yml` | `push` (master) | 66 |
| 6 | Publish | `publish.yml` | `push` (tags) | 41 |
| 7 | Labels | `labels.yml` | `push` (master, `.github/labels.toml`) | 22 |
| 8 | PR Rebase & Squash | `pr-rebase-squash.yml` | `issue_comment`, `workflow_dispatch` | 272 |
| 9 | Self-Healing CI | `self-healing-ci.yml` | `workflow_run` | 108 |
| 10 | Issue Manager | `issue-manager.yml` | `issue_comment`, `schedule` | 32 |
| 11 | Hacktoberfest | `hacktoberfest.yml` | `schedule` | 17 |

**There is no automated testing of any workflow file today.** The only
validation is GitHub's built-in YAML parsing on push and manual smoke
testing described in `docs/plans/pr-comment-rebase-squash-action.md`.

### 1.2 Complexity Assessment

Legend:
- 🔴 **High** — multi-step shell scripting, conditional logic, API calls
- 🟡 **Medium** — matrix strategies, artifacts, conditional steps
- 🟢 **Low** — simple trigger → single job → marketplace action

| Workflow | Complexity | Testable Shell Logic | Key Risks |
|---------|:----------:|:--------------------:|-----------|
| PR Rebase & Squash | 🔴 | Yes (9 shell steps) | Permission checks, command parsing, git rebase/squash, Copilot CLI fallback |
| Self-Healing CI | 🔴 | Yes (3 shell steps) | Log collection loops, PR comment construction, `workflow_run` trigger |
| Benchmarks | 🟡 | Minimal | Matrix strategy, artifact management, gh-pages deploy |
| Integration Tests | 🟡 | Minimal | Matrix with driver exclusions, service containers |
| Unit Tests | 🟡 | Minimal | Matrix (3 Python versions × 3 OSes) |
| CI | 🟡 | Minimal | Pre-commit, commitlint, semantic-release chain |
| Docs | 🟢 | No | Sphinx build, GitHub Pages deploy |
| Publish | 🟢 | No | PyPI OIDC, artifact upload |
| Labels | 🟢 | No | Single marketplace action |
| Issue Manager | 🟢 | No | Single marketplace action |
| Hacktoberfest | 🟢 | No | Single marketplace action |

**The two 🔴-complexity workflows (`pr-rebase-squash.yml` and
`self-healing-ci.yml`) contain the most shell logic and are the highest
priority for testing.**

---

## 2. Tool Comparison

### 2.1 actionlint — Static Analysis

[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) is a Go-based static
checker purpose-built for GitHub Actions workflow YAML files.

**What it catches:**
- Invalid YAML structure and unknown workflow keys
- Type errors in `${{ }}` expressions (e.g., accessing `.foo` on a string)
- Unknown action inputs/outputs and missing `required` inputs
- Insecure patterns (untrusted input in `run:` steps)
- Invalid glob patterns, runner labels, and cron expressions
- Shell syntax errors (integrates with `shellcheck`)
- Python syntax errors in `run:` steps (integrates with `pyflakes`)

**Pros:**
- Zero configuration — just run `actionlint` at repo root
- Extremely fast (<1 s for all 11 workflow files)
- Catches the most common workflow errors before push
- Integrates with pre-commit, VS Code, and CI
- No Docker dependency — single static binary

**Cons:**
- Static analysis only — cannot test runtime behavior
- Cannot simulate event payloads or step outputs
- False positives on complex expression patterns (rare)

**Applicability to coodie:** ✅ High — catches YAML and expression errors
across all 11 workflows. Best bang-for-buck as a first step.

### 2.2 act CLI — Local Workflow Runner

[act](https://github.com/nektos/act) is a Go-based CLI that runs GitHub
Actions workflows locally inside Docker containers, simulating the runner
environment.

**What it tests:**
- Full workflow execution with real steps, containers, and artifacts
- Matrix strategies and job dependencies
- Environment variables, secrets (from `.secrets` file), and outputs
- Supports custom event payloads via JSON files (`-e event.json`)

**Pros:**
- Closest to real GitHub Actions behavior without pushing
- Tests the complete orchestration: triggers → jobs → steps → outputs
- Supports most triggers including `push`, `pull_request`, `issue_comment`
- Avoids burning GitHub Actions minutes during development

**Cons:**
- **Requires Docker** — adds CI complexity and ~2 GB image pulls
- **Not 100% fidelity** — some GitHub-specific features are missing:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions model is simplified
  - `workflow_run` and `workflow_call` triggers have limited support
  - Marketplace actions with Docker-in-Docker can fail
  - `gh` CLI authentication behaves differently
- **Slow** — each run starts a Docker container (~10-30 s overhead)
- **Event simulation is fragile** — complex events like `issue_comment`
  require hand-crafted JSON payloads that drift from GitHub's actual schema
- **`pr-rebase-squash.yml` specifically** — uses `gh api` calls that
  require a real GitHub API token and a real PR; act cannot easily mock these

**Applicability to coodie:** 🔧 Medium — useful for testing simple
workflows (`test-unit.yml`, `ci.yml`) but impractical for the complex
workflows (`pr-rebase-squash.yml`) that rely on real GitHub API state.

### 2.3 Bats — Shell Script Unit Testing

[Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (Bash Automated Testing
System) is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash scripts.

**What it tests:**
- Individual shell functions and scripts extracted from `run:` steps
- Exit codes, stdout/stderr output, and side effects
- Can mock commands (e.g., mock `gh`, `git`, `copilot`) to test logic paths

**Pros:**
- Tests the actual shell logic that is hardest to debug in CI
- Fast — no Docker, no containers, sub-second execution
- Mature ecosystem: `bats-support`, `bats-assert`, `bats-mock` libraries
- Perfect for testing command parsing, permission checks, and fallback logic

**Cons:**
- Requires extracting shell logic from inline `run:` blocks into standalone
  scripts (one-time refactor)
- Tests Bash scripts, not the workflow YAML orchestration itself
- Cannot test GitHub-specific context variables (`${{ github.event.* }}`)
  without mocking

**Applicability to coodie:** ✅ High — the `pr-rebase-squash.yml` workflow
has 9 shell steps with complex conditional logic (command parsing, rebase,
squash with Copilot fallback). Extracting these into testable scripts and
testing with Bats gives the highest confidence in the most complex logic.

### 2.4 Python / pytest — YAML Validation & Script Testing

Python and pytest can be used to validate workflow YAML structure and test
helper scripts.

**What it tests:**
- YAML schema validation (are required keys present? are values valid?)
- Cross-workflow consistency (do all workflows use the same checkout action
  version? do all set `cancel-in-progress`?)
- Custom Python scripts called by workflows (if any)

**Available libraries:**
- `pyyaml` / `ruamel.yaml` — parse workflow YAML files
- `jsonschema` — validate against the official GitHub Actions JSON schema
- `pytest` — test framework for assertions
- `subprocess` — call shell scripts and assert on output

**Pros:**
- Leverages the project's existing pytest infrastructure
- Can enforce repository-specific conventions (e.g., "all workflows must
  have a concurrency group," "all checkout actions must use `@v4`")
- Very fast — YAML parsing is near-instant
- No external tool installation — pure Python

**Cons:**
- Does not validate GitHub Actions semantics (expressions, action inputs) —
  `actionlint` is strictly better for that
- Cannot test runtime workflow behavior
- Writing a full schema validator from scratch is wasted effort when
  `actionlint` already does it

**Applicability to coodie:** 🔧 Medium — useful as a complementary layer
for enforcing project-specific conventions that `actionlint` cannot check.
Should not replace `actionlint` for semantic validation.

### 2.5 GitHub Local Action Debugger

[`@github/local-action`](https://github.com/github/local-action) is
GitHub's official tool for locally testing JavaScript/TypeScript custom
Actions.

**Pros:**
- No Docker required — runs with `npx`
- Official, maintained by GitHub

**Cons:**
- **Only works for JS/TS custom Actions** — not for workflow YAML files
- Cannot test `run:` shell steps or composite actions
- Coodie does not have any custom JS/TS Actions

**Applicability to coodie:** ❌ Not applicable — the repository does not
define any custom JavaScript or TypeScript Actions.

### 2.6 workflow_dispatch — Live Smoke Tests

The `pr-rebase-squash.yml` workflow already supports `workflow_dispatch`
with `pr_number` and `command` inputs (lines 21-34). This enables
triggering the workflow manually from the Actions tab for testing.

**What it tests:**
- Full end-to-end behavior in the real GitHub environment
- Real API calls, real `GITHUB_TOKEN`, real PR state

**Pros:**
- Tests the actual production environment — 100% fidelity
- Already implemented in `pr-rebase-squash.yml`
- Can be automated via `gh workflow run` in a dedicated test workflow

**Cons:**
- Requires a real PR in the repository
- Consumes GitHub Actions minutes
- Slower than local testing (~30-60 s per run)
- Side effects (pushes force-with-lease, posts comments) require cleanup

**Applicability to coodie:** ✅ High — already available for
`pr-rebase-squash.yml`. Can be extended to other workflows. Best used as
a final validation step, not for rapid iteration.

### 2.7 Comparison Matrix

## 3. Recommended Strategy

Based on the comparison, the recommended approach is a **three-layer
testing pyramid** for workflows:

```
                  ┌──────────────────────┐
                  │  Live Smoke Tests    │  ← workflow_dispatch on real PRs
                  │  (few, slow, high    │     final validation before merge
                  │   fidelity)          │
                  └──────────┬───────────┘
                             │
                ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                │  Shell Script Unit      │  ← Bats tests for extracted scripts
                │  Tests (many, fast,     │     command parsing, git logic,
                │  focused on logic)      │     fallback paths
                └────────────┬────────────┘
                             │
          ┌──────────────────┴──────────────────┐
          │  Static Analysis + Convention       │  ← actionlint + pytest YAML checks
          │  Checks (all files, instant,        │     run on every PR, pre-commit
          │  catches misconfigurations)          │
          └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why not `act` CLI as the primary tool?**

While `act` is the most well-known workflow testing tool, it is
**not the best fit** for coodie's most complex workflows:

1. `pr-rebase-squash.yml` depends heavily on `gh api` calls with real
   PRs — `act` cannot realistically mock this state.
2. `self-healing-ci.yml` uses `workflow_run` triggers, which `act` does
   not fully support.
3. The Docker overhead (~10-30 s startup + ~2 GB image) is disproportionate
   for what are essentially Bash scripts with `gh` CLI calls.
4. The shell logic is better tested by extracting it into scripts and
   using Bats — this is faster, more targeted, and gives clearer
   failure messages.

`act` remains useful for *quick local validation of simple workflows*
(e.g., "does `test-unit.yml` matrix work?"), but it should not be the
primary testing mechanism. Developers can install it optionally.

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Static Analysis with actionlint (Priority: High)

**Goal:** Add actionlint to pre-commit and CI so every PR is validated for YAML and expression errors.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| 1.1 | Add `actionlint` hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` using the [`rhysd/actionlint`](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint/blob/main/docs/usage.md#pre-commit) pre-commit hook |
| 1.2 | Run `actionlint` locally against all 11 workflows and fix any reported errors |
| 1.3 | Add an `actionlint` step to `ci.yml` (or a new `lint-workflows.yml`) that runs on PRs touching `.github/workflows/` |
| 1.4 | Document actionlint usage in `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| 1.5 | Verify: `actionlint` passes cleanly on all 11 workflows in CI |

### Phase 2: Shell Script Extraction & Bats Tests (Priority: High)

**Goal:** Extract the complex shell logic from `pr-rebase-squash.yml` and `self-healing-ci.yml` into standalone scripts, test them with Bats, and integrate Bats into the existing pytest suite via a custom pytest plugin.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| 2.1 | Create `.github/scripts/` directory for extracted shell scripts |
| 2.2 | Extract the "Parse slash command" step (lines 130-149 of `pr-rebase-squash.yml`) into `.github/scripts/parse-command.sh` |
| 2.3 | Extract the "Squash commits" step's commit-message logic into `.github/scripts/build-squash-message.sh` |
| 2.4 | Extract the "Collect failed job logs" step from `self-healing-ci.yml` into `.github/scripts/collect-failed-logs.sh` |
| 2.5 | Update workflow YAML files to source the extracted scripts instead of inline shell |
| 2.6 | Create `tests/workflows/` directory for Bats test files |
| 2.7 | Write Bats tests for `parse-command.sh`: `/rebase`, `/squash`, `/rebase squash`, mixed-case, leading whitespace, invalid input |
| 2.8 | Write Bats tests for `build-squash-message.sh`: Copilot success, Copilot failure (fallback to PR title), error-message rejection, empty body |
| 2.9 | Write Bats tests for `collect-failed-logs.sh`: no failed jobs, one failed job, multiple failed jobs, API error |
| 2.10 | Create `tests/workflows/conftest.py` — a pytest-bats plugin that collects `.bats` files as pytest items, parses individual `@test` blocks, and runs them via `bats`, reporting pass/fail per test case (see [§2.10 Plugin Design](#210-plugin-design) below) |
| 2.11 | Add a CI job that installs `bats-core` and runs all Bats tests via `pytest tests/workflows/` on PRs touching `.github/` |
| 2.12 | Verify: all Bats tests pass locally and in CI via both `bats` directly and `pytest tests/workflows/` |

#### 2.10 Plugin Design

A custom pytest-bats conftest plugin in `tests/workflows/conftest.py`
lets developers run Bats tests with the standard `pytest` command,
getting unified reporting, familiar CLI flags (`-v`, `-k`, `--tb`), and
integration with the existing CI pipeline without a separate Bats job.

```python
"""pytest-bats plugin — collect and run .bats files as pytest items."""

from __future__ import annotations

import re
import shutil
import subprocess

import pytest


def pytest_collect_file(parent, file_path):
    """Collect .bats files as pytest test modules."""
    if file_path.suffix == ".bats" and file_path.name.startswith("test_"):
        return BatsFile.from_parent(parent, path=file_path)


class BatsFile(pytest.File):
    """A .bats file containing one or more @test blocks."""

    def collect(self):
        # Parse @test "name" { ... } blocks from the file
        content = self.path.read_text()
        for match in re.finditer(r"@test\s+\"([^\"]+)\"", content):
            name = match.group(1)
            yield BatsItem.from_parent(self, name=name)
        # If no @test blocks found, treat the whole file as one item
        if not list(re.finditer(r"@test\s+\"([^\"]+)\"", content)):
            yield BatsItem.from_parent(self, name=self.path.stem)


class BatsItem(pytest.Item):
    """A single @test case from a .bats file."""

    def runtest(self):
        if not shutil.which("bats"):
            pytest.skip("bats is not installed")
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["bats", "--filter", re.escape(self.name), str(self.path)],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True,
            timeout=30,
        )
        if result.returncode != 0:
            raise BatsTestFailure(result.stdout, result.stderr)

    def repr_failure(self, excinfo, style=None):
        if isinstance(excinfo.value, BatsTestFailure):
            return f"Bats test failed: {self.name}\n{excinfo.value}"
        return super().repr_failure(excinfo, style)

    def reportinfo(self):
        return self.path, None, f"bats: {self.name}"


class BatsTestFailure(Exception):
    """Raised when a bats test case fails."""

    def __init__(self, stdout: str, stderr: str):
        self.stdout = stdout
        self.stderr = stderr

    def __str__(self):
        parts = []
        if self.stdout.strip():
            parts.append(f"stdout:\n{self.stdout}")
        if self.stderr.strip():
            parts.append(f"stderr:\n{self.stderr}")
        return "\n".join(parts) or "(no output)"
```

**Key design decisions:**
- **Individual test granularity:** Parses `@test "name"` blocks so each
  Bats test case appears as a separate pytest item (pass/fail/skip per case)
- **`--filter` flag:** Runs only the matching `@test` block per item, so
  failure isolation is accurate
- **`shutil.which("bats")` guard:** Skips gracefully when `bats` is not
  installed (developer machines without it, or CI without the install step)
- **30 s timeout:** Prevents runaway shell scripts from hanging CI
- **Custom `repr_failure`:** Shows Bats stdout/stderr inline in pytest
  output for easy debugging

### Phase 3: Python Convention Checks (Priority: Medium)

**Goal:** Add pytest-based checks that enforce repository-specific workflow conventions that actionlint cannot verify.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| 3.1 | Create `tests/test_workflow_conventions.py` |
| 3.2 | Test: all workflows use `actions/checkout@v4` (not `@v3` or unpinned) |
| 3.3 | Test: all multi-job workflows define a `concurrency` group |
| 3.4 | Test: all workflows that use `gh` CLI set `GH_TOKEN` env var |
| 3.5 | Test: no workflow uses `actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 1` when `git rebase` or `git log` is used in a later step |
| 3.6 | Test: all `schedule` triggers have valid cron expressions |
| 3.7 | Run as part of the existing `pytest` unit test suite (no new CI job needed) |
| 3.8 | Verify: all convention tests pass |

### Phase 4: workflow_dispatch Smoke Tests (Priority: Low)

**Goal:** Document and optionally automate live smoke tests for `pr-rebase-squash.yml` using its existing `workflow_dispatch` trigger.

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| 4.1 | Document the manual smoke-test procedure in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: how to trigger via Actions tab, expected results, cleanup steps |
| 4.2 | Create a test PR template (branch `test/workflow-smoke`) with known state (2 commits, no conflicts) for reproducible testing |
| 4.3 | Add `workflow_dispatch` triggers to `self-healing-ci.yml` for manual testing (similar to how `pr-rebase-squash.yml` already has one) |
| 4.4 | Optionally: create `.github/workflows/test-workflows.yml` that runs nightly, creates a test PR, triggers `/rebase squash`, and validates the result |
| 4.5 | Verify: manual smoke test passes for all three commands (`rebase`, `squash`, `rebase squash`) |

---

## 5. Test Plan

### 5.1 Static Analysis (actionlint)

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| All 11 workflow files pass `actionlint` with zero errors | 1 |
| Pre-commit hook catches a deliberately introduced YAML error | 1 |
| CI job fails when a PR introduces an invalid workflow expression | 1 |

### 5.2 Shell Script Unit Tests (Bats)

#### `tests/workflows/test_parse_command.bats`

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| `/rebase` → `do_rebase=true`, `do_squash=false` | 2 |
| `/squash` → `do_rebase=false`, `do_squash=true` | 2 |
| `/rebase squash` → `do_rebase=true`, `do_squash=true` | 2 |
| `/REBASE` (uppercase) → `do_rebase=true` (case-insensitive) | 2 |
| `  /rebase  ` (whitespace) → `do_rebase=true` | 2 |
| `rebase` (workflow_dispatch, no leading `/`) → `do_rebase=true` | 2 |
| `rebase squash` (workflow_dispatch) → both true | 2 |
| `hello world` (no command) → both false | 2 |
| Empty string → both false | 2 |

#### `tests/workflows/test_build_squash_message.bats`

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| Copilot CLI returns valid body → message = title + body | 2 |
| Copilot CLI returns empty → fallback to PR body | 2 |
| Copilot CLI returns error text (contains "error:") → rejected, falls back | 2 |
| PR body is also empty → message = title only | 2 |
| Single-commit PR → exits with "nothing to squash" | 2 |

#### `tests/workflows/test_collect_failed_logs.bats`

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| No failed jobs → empty output | 2 |
| One failed job → logs collected with job name header | 2 |
| Multiple failed jobs → all logs concatenated | 2 |
| API call fails → graceful error handling | 2 |

### 5.3 YAML Validation (pytest)

#### `tests/test_workflow_conventions.py`

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| All workflows use pinned action versions (`@vN` or `@sha`) | 3 |
| All multi-job workflows have `concurrency` groups | 3 |
| All `run:` steps using `gh` CLI have `GH_TOKEN` in `env:` | 3 |
| All workflows with `git log`/`git rebase` use `fetch-depth: 0` | 3 |
| All `schedule` cron expressions are syntactically valid | 3 |

### 5.4 Live Smoke Tests (workflow_dispatch)

| Test Case | Phase |
|---|---|
| `/rebase` on a PR with no conflicts → branch rebased, comment posted | 4 |
| `/squash` on a multi-commit PR → single commit with PR title as subject | 4 |
| `/rebase squash` → rebase then squash in one run | 4 |
| Trigger on closed PR → workflow exits with "not open" error | 4 |
| `self-healing-ci.yml` manual trigger → failure comment posted on test PR | 4 |
