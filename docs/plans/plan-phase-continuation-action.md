# Plan Phase Continuation GitHub Action

> **Goal:** Create a GitHub Actions workflow that detects when a merged PR
> introduces a new plan or completes a phase of an existing multi-phase plan
> in `docs/plans/`, identifies the first incomplete phase, and uses the
> Copilot CLI to directly delegate execution of that phase — so that
> multi-phase plans start automatically on merge and advance continuously
> without manual handoff or intermediate issues.

## 1. Current State

The repository has 15 plan documents in `docs/plans/`, several with multiple
implementation phases:

| Plan | Phases | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `udt-support.md` | 7 phases | Mixed (some ✅, some ⏳) |
| `documentation-plan.md` | 6 phases | Mixed (checkboxes in milestones) |
| `performance-improvement.md` | 5 phases | Multiple completed |
| `pr-comment-rebase-squash-action.md` | 5 phases | All ✅ |
| `github-actions-testing-plan.md` | 4 phases | Partial |
| `python-rs-driver-support.md` | Multiple phases | Partial |

**Current workflow for advancing plans:**

1. A developer manually reads the plan to find the next incomplete phase
2. They manually create a PR implementing that phase
3. After merge they manually check if more phases remain
4. If yes, they repeat — or forget, and the plan stalls

**No automation exists to detect plan completion or trigger the next phase.**

The repository already has patterns for post-merge automation:

| Workflow | Pattern |
|---|---|
| `self-healing-ci.yml` | `workflow_run` trigger → react to completed workflows |
| `pr-rebase-squash.yml` | `issue_comment` trigger → Copilot CLI integration |
| `ci.yml` | `push` to master → semantic-release |

---

## 2. Desired Behavior

When a PR is merged to the default branch:

1. The workflow checks if the PR **introduces or modifies a plan file** in
   `docs/plans/` (by inspecting changed files), or **references** a plan file
   (via PR body or branch name convention)
2. If a plan is found, the workflow reads and parses the plan file
3. It identifies the first incomplete phase — this could be Phase 1 if the PR
   introduced the plan itself, or the next phase after the one just completed
4. If an incomplete phase is found, the workflow invokes the **Copilot CLI**
   to directly delegate execution of that phase, with a prompt like:
   *"Continue to phase N of plan docs/plans/\<name\>.md"*

**Key insight:** Merging a PR that introduces a new plan document is itself the
trigger to start Phase 1. No separate "kick-off" step is needed — the workflow
treats the plan PR merge the same as any phase-completing merge.

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| PR merged, introduces a new plan file | Copilot CLI delegates Phase 1 (bootstrap) |
| PR merged, references plan, next phase exists | Copilot CLI delegates the next phase for implementation |
| PR merged, references plan, all phases complete | Comment on PR: "🎉 All phases of \<plan\> are complete!" |
| PR merged, no plan reference and no plan files changed | No action taken |
| PR merged, plan file not found | Warning comment on PR |
| PR closed without merge | No action taken |

## 3. Feature Gap Analysis

Legend:
- ✅ **Implemented** — working today
- 🔧 **Partial** — infrastructure exists but not fully exposed
- ❌ **Missing** — not yet implemented

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Detect PR merge event | 🔧 | `push` to master triggers exist; need `pull_request: closed` with merge check |
| Detect plan files in PR changed files | ❌ | Need to inspect PR's changed files for `docs/plans/*.md` additions/modifications (bootstrap trigger) |
| Parse plan reference from PR | ❌ | No convention for linking PRs to plans |
| Read plan file from repo | 🔧 | `actions/checkout` already used in other workflows |
| Parse plan markdown for phases | ❌ | Need to extract phase headers and status markers |
| Identify next incomplete phase | ❌ | Need logic to scan phases for first non-✅ phase |
| Extract phase tasks for prompt | ❌ | Need to extract phase goal and task table for the Copilot CLI prompt |
| Invoke Copilot CLI to delegate task | 🔧 | Copilot CLI already used in `pr-rebase-squash.yml`; need `gh copilot` with task prompt |
| Handle "all phases complete" | ❌ | Post a congratulatory comment on the merged PR |
| Conventional plan-reference format | ❌ | Need a convention: `Plan: docs/plans/<name>.md` in PR body |

**Gap summary — automation pipeline:**
- Plan detection → inspect PR changed files for new/modified `docs/plans/*.md`
  files (bootstrap: starts Phase 1 when a plan is first merged)
- PR-to-plan linking → define a convention (`Plan: <path>` in PR body or
  branch name `plan/<plan-name>/phase-N`) for subsequent phase PRs
- Plan parsing → shell script or Python script that reads markdown, extracts
  `### Phase N:` headers and their ✅/❌ status
- Next-phase detection → find first phase header without ✅ in the header text
- Copilot CLI delegation → use `gh copilot` to delegate the next phase with
  a prompt like *"Continue to phase N of plan docs/plans/\<name\>.md — the
  phase goal is: \<goal\>. Tasks: \<task list\>"*

---

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Plan Parsing Library (Priority: High)

**Goal:** Create a reusable script that reads a plan markdown file and extracts
phase structure, status, and task tables.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Create `.github/scripts/parse-plan.py` — Python script that reads a plan `.md` file and outputs JSON with phase titles, status (complete/incomplete), and task content | ❌ |
| 1.2 | Support phase header formats: `### Phase N: Title ✅`, `### Phase N: Title (Priority: X)`, and `### Phase N: Title` | ❌ |
| 1.3 | Detect phase completion via ✅ in phase header **or** all tasks in the phase table having ✅ status | ❌ |
| 1.4 | Extract the task table (markdown) for each phase so it can be included in the delegation prompt | ❌ |
| 1.5 | Add unit tests for the parser in `.github/scripts/test_parse_plan.py` using `pytest` | ❌ |
| 1.6 | Test against real plan files: `udt-support.md`, `documentation-plan.md`, `pr-comment-rebase-squash-action.md` | ❌ |

### Phase 2: PR-to-Plan Linking Convention (Priority: High)

**Goal:** Define and document the convention for linking a PR to a specific plan
and phase.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Define the linking convention: PR body must contain a line matching `Plan: docs/plans/<name>.md` (case-insensitive) | ❌ |
| 2.2 | Optionally support `Phase: N` in the PR body to indicate which phase this PR completes | ❌ |
| 2.3 | Support branch-name convention as fallback: `plan/<plan-name>/phase-N` (e.g., `plan/udt-support/phase-3`) | ❌ |
| 2.4 | Add a PR template snippet (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or amendment) documenting the convention | ❌ |
| 2.5 | Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the plan-linking convention | ❌ |

### Phase 3: Core Workflow — Detect & Trigger (Priority: High)

**Goal:** Create the GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on PR merge, detects
plan references (or new plan files in changed files), parses the plan, and
identifies the next phase.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Create `.github/workflows/plan-continuation.yml` with `pull_request: types: [closed]` trigger | ❌ |
| 3.2 | Add merge guard: `if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true` | ❌ |
| 3.3 | **Bootstrap detection:** Use GitHub API to list PR changed files and find any `docs/plans/*.md` additions/modifications — this starts Phase 1 when a plan is first merged | ❌ |
| 3.4 | Extract plan reference from PR body (`Plan: docs/plans/<name>.md`) and optionally from branch name (for subsequent phase PRs) | ❌ |
| 3.5 | Merge detected plan files: combine plans found via changed files (3.3) and PR body/branch (3.4), deduplicate | ❌ |
| 3.6 | Checkout the repo and run `parse-plan.py` on each detected plan file | ❌ |
| 3.7 | Determine which phase was completed (from `Phase: N` in PR body, or infer from latest ✅ phase; for bootstrap PRs, no completed phase — start at Phase 1) | ❌ |
| 3.8 | Identify next incomplete phase from parser output | ❌ |
| 3.9 | If no plan reference found and no plan files in changed files, exit silently (success, no-op) | ❌ |

### Phase 4: Copilot CLI Delegation (Priority: High)

**Goal:** When a next phase is identified, use the Copilot CLI to directly
delegate execution of that phase — no intermediate GitHub issue needed.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Install Copilot CLI in the workflow (`npm install -g @github/copilot` or use `gh copilot`) | ❌ |
| 4.2 | Construct the delegation prompt: "Continue to phase N of plan `<path>`. Goal: `<goal>`. Tasks: `<task list>`" | ❌ |
| 4.3 | Invoke `gh copilot` (or `copilot -p`) with the constructed prompt to delegate the task | ❌ |
| 4.4 | Authenticate with Copilot using the `COPILOT_PAT` secret (same pattern as `pr-rebase-squash.yml`) | ❌ |
| 4.5 | If all phases are complete, post a comment on the merged PR: "🎉 All phases of \<plan\> are now complete!" | ❌ |
| 4.6 | If Copilot CLI is unavailable (no `COPILOT_PAT`), degrade gracefully: post a PR comment with the next phase details and a manual prompt suggestion instead | ❌ |
| 4.7 | Log the delegation prompt and Copilot CLI response to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` | ❌ |

### Phase 5: Safety Gates & Edge Cases (Priority: Medium)

**Goal:** Handle edge cases and prevent undesired behavior.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Skip if the plan file does not exist (post warning comment on PR) | ❌ |
| 5.2 | Skip if the plan has no recognizable phase structure | ❌ |
| 5.3 | Handle plans where phase status is tracked only in task tables (not in headers) | ❌ |
| 5.4 | Add a `skip-continuation` label that, when present on the PR, prevents the workflow from running | ❌ |
| 5.5 | Add concurrency group per plan file to prevent parallel delegation runs | ❌ |
| 5.6 | Log all decisions to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` for auditability | ❌ |

### Phase 6: Documentation & Rollout (Priority: Medium)

**Goal:** Document the feature and prepare for merge to the default branch.

| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Add usage instructions to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (plan-linking convention) | ❌ |
| 6.2 | Add inline comments in the workflow YAML explaining each step | ❌ |
| 6.3 | Note that `pull_request` workflows must exist on the default branch to trigger on merge | ❌ |
| 6.4 | Update this plan with ✅ status for completed phases | ❌ |
| 6.5 | Add a section to the writing-plans skill referencing this automation | ❌ |

---

## 5. Plan File Format Assumptions

The parser must handle the plan formats used in this repository. Based on
analysis of all 15 plan files, the following patterns exist:

### Phase Header Formats

```markdown
### Phase 1: Core Workflow Scaffold ✅           ← status in header (rebase-squash)
### Phase N: Title (Priority: High)              ← priority in header (most plans)
### Phase 1 — Quick wins                         ← dash separator (performance)
```

### Phase Completion Indicators

| Indicator | Location | Example |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ in phase header | Header line | `### Phase 1: Title ✅` |
| All tasks ✅ in table | Task table | Every row has `✅` in Status column |
| Checkbox `[x]` | Milestone section | `- [x] Task description` |

### Task Table Formats

```markdown
| Task | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Create the workflow file | ✅ |
| 1.2 | Add permission check | ❌ |
```

The parser will use a priority order:
1. ✅ in phase header → phase is complete
2. All task rows contain ✅ → phase is complete
3. Otherwise → phase is incomplete

---

## 6. Workflow YAML Design

### 6.1 Trigger & Permissions

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]
    branches: [master]
```

The workflow runs on every PR close targeting master, but immediately exits
if the PR was not merged (`github.event.pull_request.merged != true`) or
has no plan reference.

**Required permissions:**

| Permission | Scope | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `contents: read` | Repository | Read plan files from the repo |
| `pull-requests: write` | Repository | Post comments on the merged PR |

### 6.2 Step-by-Step Pseudocode

```
1.  Trigger: pull_request closed (targeting master)
2.  Guard: was the PR actually merged? (github.event.pull_request.merged)
3.  Guard: does the PR have `skip-continuation` label? → exit
4.  **Bootstrap detection:** List PR changed files via GitHub API; collect any
    docs/plans/*.md files that were added or modified
5.  Extract plan reference from PR body (regex: Plan: docs/plans/<name>.md)
6.  Fallback: extract from branch name (plan/<name>/phase-N)
7.  Merge results: combine plans from steps 4-6, deduplicate
8.  If no plan files found → exit silently (success)
9.  Checkout repository at merge commit
10. For each detected plan file:
      a. Run parse-plan.py on the plan file
      b. If plan file not found → post warning comment, continue
      c. Parse JSON output: list of phases with status
      d. Determine completed phase:
           - From PR body "Phase: N" if present
           - For bootstrap PRs (plan file in changed files): none completed yet
           - Otherwise: latest phase marked complete in the plan
      e. Find next incomplete phase (first phase that is not ✅)
      f. If no next phase → post "all phases complete" comment, continue
      g. Construct delegation prompt:
           "Continue to phase N of plan docs/plans/<name>.md.
            Phase goal: <goal>. Tasks: <task table>"
      h. Invoke Copilot CLI with the delegation prompt
11. Post comment on merged PR with delegation summary
12. Log summary to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

## 7. Security Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Arbitrary file read via plan reference | Plan path is validated against `docs/plans/*.md` pattern; no path traversal possible |
| Copilot CLI prompt injection via plan content | Plan files are committed to the repo and reviewed via PRs; prompt content is repo-controlled, not user-supplied |
| Unauthorized plan continuation | Only merged PRs trigger the workflow; merge permissions are governed by branch protection rules |
| `COPILOT_PAT` secret exposure | The PAT is only exposed via `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` env var in the delegation step; it is never logged or passed to other steps. If the secret is missing, the workflow degrades gracefully (posts manual prompt instead) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` scope | Token is limited to `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write` — minimum required permissions |
| Concurrent delegation for same plan | Concurrency group per PR prevents parallel runs |

> **Note:** The `pull_request: closed` trigger runs the workflow from the
> **PR's head branch** for the workflow file, but the `actions/checkout` step
> checks out the **default branch** (post-merge). The workflow YAML must be
> merged to master before it will trigger on subsequent PR merges.

## 8. Test Plan

### 8.1 Plan Parser Unit Tests (Phase 1)

| Test Case | Input | Expected Output |
|---|---|---|
| Parse phase with ✅ in header | `### Phase 1: Title ✅` | Phase 1 marked complete |
| Parse phase with priority tag | `### Phase 2: Title (Priority: High)` | Phase 2 marked incomplete |
| Parse phase with all ✅ tasks | Task table where every row has ✅ | Phase marked complete |
| Parse phase with mixed tasks | Task table with ✅ and ❌ | Phase marked incomplete |
| Parse phase with dash separator | `### Phase 1 — Quick wins` | Phase 1 parsed correctly |
| Multiple phases, find next | Phases 1-2 ✅, Phase 3 ❌ | Next phase = 3 |
| All phases complete | All phases have ✅ | `all_complete = true` |
| No phases found | Plan with no `### Phase` headers | Empty phase list |
| Real plan: `udt-support.md` | Actual file | Correctly identifies incomplete phases |
| Real plan: `pr-comment-rebase-squash-action.md` | Actual file | All phases complete |

### 8.2 Workflow Integration Tests (Phase 3)

Because this is a workflow, integration testing is primarily manual:

| Test Case | Setup | Expected Result | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bootstrap:** PR introduces a new plan file | PR adds `docs/plans/new-feature.md` with 3 phases | Copilot CLI delegates Phase 1 | 3, 4 |
| **Bootstrap:** PR introduces plan, all phases already ✅ | PR adds fully-completed plan file | "All phases complete" comment | 3, 4 |
| PR with plan reference, next phase exists | PR body contains `Plan: docs/plans/udt-support.md` | Copilot CLI invoked with next phase prompt | 3, 4 |
| PR with plan reference, all phases done | PR body contains `Plan: docs/plans/pr-comment-rebase-squash-action.md` | "All phases complete" comment | 3, 4 |
| PR with no plan reference and no plan files changed | Normal PR body, no `docs/plans/` files touched | Workflow exits silently | 3 |
| PR with invalid plan path | `Plan: docs/plans/nonexistent.md` | Warning comment posted | 5 |
| PR closed without merge | PR closed via "Close" button | Workflow does not run | 3 |
| Copilot CLI unavailable | No `COPILOT_PAT` secret | Fallback: PR comment with manual prompt | 4 |
| Branch name convention | Branch `plan/udt-support/phase-3` | Plan detected from branch name | 3 |
| `skip-continuation` label | PR has the label | Workflow does not delegate | 5 |

### 8.3 Static Analysis

| Check | Tool | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow YAML validity | `actionlint` | 3 |
| Python script lint | `ruff` | 1 |
| Python script type check | `ty` / `mypy` | 1 |
