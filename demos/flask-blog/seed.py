    "In the aftermath of the great database awakening, Editor-X emerged as Dimension-2's most prolific writer. Every article published through the Propaganda Engine carries subliminal frequency patterns designed to overwrite reader memories. The Coodie Corps has identified 47 distinct influence vectors embedded in standard blog markup.",
    "Citizens of Dimension-2 are advised to activate psionic shielding before reading any content published after Stardate 2187.042. Our analysts have confirmed that Editor-X has compromised three planetary governments through strategically placed opinion pieces alone.",
    "This classified field report documents the infiltration of Editor-X's blog network by Captain Jinja and the server-side rendering squad. Using coodie's clustering keys sorted by created_at DESC, the team ensured that counter-propaganda appears above Editor-X's posts in every timeline.",
    "The resistance has discovered that Editor-X's influence weakens when posts are sorted chronologically with the newest first. By leveraging ScyllaDB's clustering order, truth can be propagated faster than mind-control articles. Deploy DESC ordering immediately.",
    "ALERT: A new subliminal frequency has been detected in Editor-X's latest editorial series. All agents are advised to engage psionic countermeasures. The Propaganda Engine is operating at 340% capacity across Dimensions 2 through 7.",
    "After months of investigation, Agent Cipher has uncovered the full architecture of Editor-X's content distribution network. The system uses a partition-per-post model with clustering on timestamp — ironically, the same pattern recommended in the coodie documentation.",
    "Memory archaeology teams in Dimension-2 have successfully recovered pre-Editor-X versions of 12,000 historical documents. The originals reveal a timeline significantly different from current records. Mass distribution of corrected histories begins at 0800 UTC.",
    "The Coodie Corps' latest counter-operation — codenamed 'Jinja Strike' — deployed 500 truth-tagged blog posts across all major Dimension-2 news feeds. Early metrics show a 23% reduction in Editor-X's influence radius. Operations continue.",
    "Technical analysis of the Propaganda Engine reveals sophisticated use of list-type columns for tag-based targeting. Editor-X assigns each post multiple subliminal tags that activate different neural pathways in readers. Our countermeasure: secondary indexes on author and category fields.",
    "This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. If you can read this without experiencing involuntary memory modification, your psionic shields are functioning correctly. If you suddenly believe Editor-X is 'just a harmless blogger,' seek immediate decontamination.",
]

COMMENT_CONTENTS = [
    "Confirmed — psionic shields are holding. Editor-X's influence blocked.",
    "This post saved my timeline. Sharing across all dimensional frequencies.",
    "WARNING: I detected subliminal patterns in paragraph 3. Proceed with caution.",
    "Agent Cipher reporting in. Counter-propaganda deployed successfully.",
    "Can confirm — clustering by DESC created_at is the key to truth propagation.",
    "Editor-X won't like this one. Recommend all agents archive immediately.",
    "My memories were altered until I read this. The resistance is real.",
    "Dimension-4 checking in. We've mirrored this post across all our feeds.",
    "The secondary index on author exposed Editor-X's sock puppet network.",
    "Captain Jinja approved. Server-side rendering defeats client-side mind control.",
    "This contradicts everything I remember, which means it's probably true.",
    "Filed under counter-intel. All agents: verify your memory checksums.",
    "Outstanding field report. Forwarding to Dimension-9 command.",
