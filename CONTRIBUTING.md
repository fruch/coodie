# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs to [our issue page][gh-issues]. If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

coodie could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official coodie docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback [our issue page][gh-issues] on GitHub. If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome 😊

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set yourself up for local development.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (recommended) or pip
- **Docker** (for integration tests)

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Fork & clone
git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/coodie.git
cd coodie

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync --all-extras

# Or with pip
pip install -e ".[scylla]"
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pre-commit

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Run unit tests (no database needed)
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run linters
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run ruff format --check src/ tests/

# Or run all pre-commit hooks at once
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests need a running ScyllaDB instance. The test suite uses
[testcontainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-python)
to start one automatically:

```bash
# Run integration tests (starts ScyllaDB via Docker)
uv run pytest tests/ -v -m integration
```

### Creating a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

### Committing

Commit messages must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(something): your detailed description of your changes"
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Examples:

- `feat(aio): add TTL support to Document.save()`
- `fix(cql_builder): escape column names with reserved words`
- `docs: update quickstart guide`
- `test(sync): add QuerySet chaining coverage`

We run [`commitlint` on CI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/commit-linter) to validate commit messages. If you've installed pre-commit hooks, the message will be checked at commit time.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Submit a pull request through the GitHub website or using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --fill
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

We like to have the pull request open as soon as possible, that's a great place to discuss any piece of work, even unfinished. You can use draft pull request if it's still a work in progress. Here are a few guidelines to follow:

1. Include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. Update the documentation for significant features.
3. Ensure tests are passing on CI.

### Slash Commands

Maintainers and collaborators with write access can use slash-commands in PR
comments to automate branch maintenance:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/rebase` | Rebase the PR branch onto the base branch. If conflicts arise, the workflow attempts to resolve them with GitHub Copilot CLI. |
| `/squash` | Squash all PR commits into a single commit. The commit message is generated by Copilot CLI following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, with a generic fallback if Copilot is unavailable. |
| `/rebase squash` | Rebase first, then squash (combines both operations in one run). |

After each operation the workflow posts a summary comment on the PR. A 🚀
reaction is added on success, or 😕 on failure.

> **When to use `/rebase` vs `/squash`:** Use `/rebase` when your branch is
> behind the base branch and you want to bring it up to date while preserving
> individual commits. Use `/squash` when the PR has many small or
> work-in-progress commits and you want a clean single-commit history before
> merging. Use `/rebase squash` to do both at once.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -k "test_something" -v
```

## Making a new release

Publishing to PyPI is triggered automatically whenever a tag matching `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (e.g. `v1.0.0`) is pushed to the repository. The [Publish to PyPI](.github/workflows/publish.yml) GitHub Actions workflow will build the package and publish it using [Trusted Publishing](#setting-up-trusted-publishing-on-pypi) — no API tokens or credentials are stored in GitHub secrets.

### Setting up Trusted Publishing on PyPI

[Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) lets PyPI verify GitHub Actions runs via OpenID Connect (OIDC), so you never have to create or rotate a PyPI API token.

**One-time setup steps (done once per PyPI project):**

1. Go to <https://pypi.org> and log in.
2. Open the project page for `coodie`, then go to **Manage → Publishing**.
   - If the project does not exist yet, go to <https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/> to add a *pending* publisher before the first upload.
3. Click **Add a new publisher** and fill in the form:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Owner | `fruch` |
   | Repository name | `coodie` |
   | Workflow name | `publish.yml` |
   | Environment name | `release` |

4. Click **Add**.

**GitHub repository setup:**

1. In the repository, go to **Settings → Environments** and create an environment named **`release`**.
2. Optionally add protection rules (e.g. require a reviewer before the publish job runs).

Once this is done, pushing a version tag such as `v1.0.0` will trigger the workflow and PyPI will accept the upload without any stored credentials.
